# House-Prices-California

This project is about predicting and categorizing house prices in California. I used machine learning to estimate prices and sort them into "High" or "Low" categories based on the median price.

What’s in This Repository?

House_Prices_Assignment.ipynb: This is the main notebook where all the code is, including:

Loading and cleaning the data.

Creating a regression model to predict house prices.

Creating a classification model to categorize prices as "High" or "Low."

Dataset: If the dataset is uploaded, you’ll see it here. If not, you can find the California housing data on Kaggle.

Steps I Followed
Data Preparation: Loaded the dataset and made it ready for analysis.
Regression Model: Built a simple model to predict house prices.
Classification Model: Made another model to label prices as "High" or "Low" based on the median.
Results: Included performance scores for both models to see how well they did.
Results Summary
Regression Model: Gives a rough estimate of house prices.
Classification Model: Does a good job of labeling prices as "High" or "Low" with around 80% accuracy.
